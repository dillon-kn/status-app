#  Status App

This app was 1/4 inspired by Instagram notes, 1/4 inspired by Find My from Apple, and 1/2 inspired by a problem that I had. I have the honor of having multiple friends from multiple different friend groups who are interested in going rock climbing with me at the Stanford Climbing Wall. They all say "hey, let me know the next time you go climbing and i'll see if i can pull up." The problem is that there's just so many of them, and to create a group chat just so that I could tell a wide assortment of people that I'm climbing seems rather narcisstic.

Thus was born this Status app (not TM). In essence, my app allows you to share with your friends what your current "status" is--maybe it's "climbing" or maybe it's "grinding" or maybe it's "vibing," and if you turn on notifications (feature in progress), your friends will all know! No matter the case, all of your friends can see what you're up to (should you choose to update and share that status), and if they're interested in joining you, they can contact you (feature in progress). I'm not sure precisely how useful this app would be for other people, but it certainly was a fun challenge building the majority of the MVP throughout summer 2024. 

Thanks for reading,
